        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p id="about_info">
            The Generous Hearts foundation(Giving Impetus to Voluntary Effort) is a non profit organisation in India. It is an online donation platform and aims to channel and provide resources to credible non-governmental organisations across India.
            As a web portal, it helps raise funds and contributions from individuals across India and the world and then disburses these donations to credible Indian NGOs.
            After a rigorous and thorough document based due diligence, supplemented by a visit or a strong reference, The Generous Hearts foundation lists NGOs on its website. As of April 2011, The Generous Hearts foundation has selected over 270 charitable organisations that are recommended on its website after reviewing more than 3,000 nonprofit organisations from all over India. 
            The Generous Hearts foundation works across ten causes and lists charities ranging from charity for children to charity for education, health, employment, elderly, disability, human rights, environment, youth and women's empowerment. The Generous Hearts foundation also lets its donors know where exactly their donation was used and also give them a proof of it through a feedback report.
            Every feedback report contains the details of the beneficiaries who were benefited from each donation. The Generous Hearts foundation also issues an instant e-tax receipt upon making a donation. The donations are either 80G (50% tax exempt) or 35AC (100% tax exempt). The Generous Hearts foundation has one of the lowest costs of fundraising in India.
            The Generous Hearts foundation was created to allow secure donation options for potential donors and provide them with access to over one hundred NGOs
